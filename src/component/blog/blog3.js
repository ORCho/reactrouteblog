            <h1>Learning is a good habit</h1>
            When I teach my kids, I alway ask them what do you like. For me I like drawing and painting as a little girl. Although my husband and I have to work very hard to support our family, both of us still want our child to pursue something different from the social value system. And we believe learning is a habit not just for today's bread but for the personal growth which we want to pass onto our kids.
