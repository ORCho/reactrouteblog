I am used to play with excel in company to explore and demonstrate data. But it is not so efficient for a big amount of raw data. So I learned other softwares like Tableau and QlikView. But these tools hide too much backend information for me to understand the working logic. So I tried to learn Python and R which have many useful analysis libraries. These tools are quite useful for me.</div>
